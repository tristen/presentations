  Hi
  <aside>
    What I do at Mapbox
    Decorate/push pixels and largely work on Frontend code.
  </aside>
</div>

<div>
  Outline:
  <ol>
    <li>Rendering maps at Mapbox</li>
    <li>Data scenarios</li>
    <li>Demos!</li>
  </ol>
  <aside>
    - I have an outline of things I want to talk which I think eventually ends up relating to GIS.
    - I also have no idea how long this will take
    - I want to talk about the various data improvements we made to serve 
    big data.
    - It segways into how we're thinking about solving big data problems. A problem you might
    already be familiar with data processing and analyizing data on a map.

  1.&nbsp;Rendering maps at Mapbox
</div>

<div>
  Mapbox
  <br />
  2010&nbsp;&#9758;&nbsp;present
  <aside>
    - Just focusing on the history of web maps where Mapbox begins
    - Before Mapbox branched off of Devseed, talk about building maps for
      -- World Bank
      -- NPR
      -- Energy.gov
    - Using the work of a small number of open source contributors in the space
      -- OpenLayers
  </aside>
</div>

<div>
  Map rendering has been down a long beaten path
  <aside>
    - You work a large amount of data from various sources and formats
    - Compile it all together and serve it to a client
    - As an example, the OSM dataset is ~30gigs and you typically see ~0.00172%; 
    - The biggest improvement in data performance is what you choose not to draw
    - At this stage Google solved slippy maps with z/x/y tiled images
      - I should note that this was a very important decision and informs
      even the fast webgl maps we have today. A coordinate system for tiles 
      was huge.

  TileMill &#9758;

  Mapbox&nbsp;Studio&nbsp;Classic&nbsp;&#9758;
  <br />
  Mapbox Studio 
  <aside>
    - Our tools for map design have followed along its path for awhile.

  TileMill
  <aside>
    - Familiar with TileMill? It was our first released design studio for creating maps
    - Supported connecting to custom databases for map data
  </aside>
</div>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Data &#9758; styled raster maps
    </li>
    <li>
      CartoCSS
    </li>
  </ul>

  <aside>
    - CartoCSS is the styling language inspired by CSS. It's an abstraction for 
    writing style attributes in Mapnik
    - Feels slow today but it was an improvement as it reused and cached tiles.
    - Optimization came from using .mbtiles. 
    - Talk about .mbtiles quick (small take with you sqlite db)
    - A blue square means it's blue all the way down

  Mapbox Studio Classic
  <aside>
    Mapbox Studio Classic was a short-lived project. In many ways it was a hold
    out until we built Web GL rendering for vector tiles.
  </aside>
</div>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Data &#9758; vector tiles &#9758; styled raster maps
    </li>
    <li>
      CartoCSS
    </li>
  </ul>
  <aside>
    - This is where we experiment with Vector Tiles
    - Data is cached and vector tiles are stored as protocal buffer's
    - That's like a .pbf file you may have seen (More props to Google)
    - Small compact binary encoding that can be decoded quickly.
    - Ridiculously faster than request images.
    - And becuase of this we can now serve the world out of a box

  Mapbox Studio
  <aside>
    This is our latest design tool. Online and fast. 
  </aside>
</div>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Data &#9758; vector tiles &#9758; clientside styling &amp; rendered maps
    </li>
    <li>
      <strike>CartoCSS</strike> JSON
    </li>
  </ul>
  <aside>
    - Thanks to vector tiles this changes everything and we can use Web GL for rendering
    - No more CartoCSS. JSON is a readable format and crosses into the realm
      of both online interactions (JSON is JavaScript) and for manual adjustments
      (see demos)
  </aside>
</div>

<div>
  <span class='overlay'></span>
  Floating point zooms
  <aside>
    - Vector tiles can be looslessly transformed.

    - Full data introspection

  2.&nbsp;Data scenarios
  <aside>
    - I mention everything in step one to really shorten the role of this 
    section.
  </aside>
</div>

<div>
  Q: Big Data?
  <br />
  A: Vector Tiles
  <br />
  <br />
  Q: Just enough data?
  <br />
  A: GeoJSON
  <aside>
    - Data processing is another story but for actual production 
    (I'm bias here) there's two options: GeoJSON and Vector tiles
  </aside>
</div>

<div>
  3.&nbsp;Demos!
</div>

<div>
  Conclusion
  <aside>
    - Learn JavaScript
    - Because of it's lively community and ubiquity thanks to browsers it's worth 
    gleaning its tools out there for your own needs
    - Not to mention hardware is being accelerated for it. Clientside rendering
    has never had it so easy.

    - npm.org a great place to go. This is a package manager useful for sharing code.
